# Testing

## Testing Procedure

Testing has been split into several sections. 

The first section of testing has been completed around validating that the user stories are met by the website.

Manual testing is the next section of testing - this is split between Functionality/Usability testing, which ensures that the website functions correctly are is useable by the user. The second part of manual testing to responsiveness testing - this ensures that the responsive design of the website is working correctly.

The next section of testing is automated testing - this looks at validating that the code itself is free from errors using.

Browser testing is the next section of testing - this ensures that the website functions in multiple browsers.

Finally, a Lighthouse Report is produced for each page of the website.
