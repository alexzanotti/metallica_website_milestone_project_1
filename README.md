# Purpose
This website was made to provide information and content regarding the metal band Metallica. A home page contains information about the band, as well as links to other pages of the site. The gallery page provides images of the band throughout the decades. The media page provides audio samples of songs from the band, live music videos and interviews with the band.

The target audience is anyone who is a fan of the band itself, metal music fans in general or users who'd like to learn more about the band (more on ideal users/user stories below).

This website was made for the first of four milestone projects required to complete the diploma in software development program at The Code Institute.

# Project Requirements
In order to pass this milstone project, the following requirements must be met:
1. Technologies Required: HTML, CSS 
2. Optional Technologies: Bootstrap and/or other CSS libraries/frameworks.
3. Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
4. Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
5. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
6. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
7. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
8. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

## Value to users

In general, the design of the website is in line with the Metallica brand - the website is responsively designed, to make for a pleasant user experience.

Value has been provided to satisfy the various user profiles/stories, as the website was structured around the user stories. For example, there is a user story for the Metallica fan to be able to see images of the band throughout the years. Value provided by the website to satisfy this user requirement is having a gallery page, where pictures have been displayed in a stylish manner through each decade of the band since inception.

In another example of value provided to the user, there is a user story for a metal fan to be able to listen to audio snippets of the band songs, to gauge whether they like the music produced by Metallica. To answer this user story, a media page has been created that contains an audio section, providing 30 seconds of some of the most popular Metallica songs. The user can start/stop these audio snippets to get a better understanding of whether they'll like the Metallica songs.
